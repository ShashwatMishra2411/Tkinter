# Tkinter

This repository contains a GUI made using Tkinter which displays a collection of my Python programs that demonstrate various concepts and provide interactive experiences. The programs are built using different libraries and modules in Python.

# Programs Included
- Snake Game: Play the classic Snake game, where you control a snake that grows longer by eating food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries or its own body.
- Hangman Game: Guess the hidden word by guessing individual letters. Be careful, as incorrect guesses result in the drawing of a hangman. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
- Turtle Programs: Explore the world of turtle graphics with various visual creations, including drawing shapes, logos, and patterns.

# Requirements
To run these programs, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the following libraries are required:

- Tkinter: Used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI).
- Requests: Used for making HTTP requests to retrieve word lists for the Hangman game.
- Json: Used for handling JSON data in the Hangman game.
- Pygame: Used for creating interactive games and graphics.
